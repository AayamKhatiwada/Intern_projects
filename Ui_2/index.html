        <div class="desc-lawyer">
            <p> Divorce can be a difficult time, with both emotional and legal problems. Many people
                who go through it find themselves vulnerable and make bad decisions. That is why it is so important to
                get a
                lawyer, as an advisor of the whole legal process. They will get to know all the causes for the divorce
                and
                the relationship between both parties, so they will be able to look for the best solution.</p>
            <p> A divorce lawyer works towards the most favourable way for his client to divide the
                family estate. In some
                cases, each spouse may separate the property they brought into the marriage, while others may have
                accumulated assets separately according to an agreement. An attorney can explain whether the estate is a
                community property estate or an appropriate distribution estate, which can make a drastic difference in
                the
                distribution of marital property.
            </p>
            <p> As an attorney, I work hard to make this process less traumatic. I provide objective
                advice to my clients on
                how the process may affect their future, and I can also serve as an intermediary between spouses if they
                wish to avoid personal contact to facilitate the process.</p>
