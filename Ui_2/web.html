        <div class="descLawyer">
            <pre> Divorce can be a difficult time, with both emotional and legal problems. Many people who
            go through it find themselves vulnerable and make bad decisions. That is why it is so important to get a
            lawyer, as an advisor of the whole legal process. They will get to know all the causes for the divorce and
            the relationship between both parties, so they will be able to look for the best solution.

            A divorce lawyer works towards the most favourable way for his client to divide the family estate. In some
            cases, each spouse may separate the property they brought into the marriage, while others may have
            accumulated assets separately according to an agreement. An attorney can explain whether the estate is a
            community property estate or an appropriate distribution estate, which can make a drastic difference in the
            distribution of marital property.

            As an attorney, I work hard to make this process less traumatic. I provide objective advice to my clients on
            how the process may affect their future, and I can also serve as an intermediary between spouses if they
            wish to avoid personal contact to facilitate the process.
